# Android-Async-Callback-Example-with-Progressbar
This is a sample code for executing HTTP tasks accordingly without using the get() method but rather a callback method. 

The get() method hogs the main thread which is bad practice while using the AsyncTask. Code will display best practices to handle HTTP requests that take a long time.

The code is self explanatory with good comments.
